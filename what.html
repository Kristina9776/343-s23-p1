                <h1>Reading techniques</h1>
                <p>Work with Dr. Daniel or the TA's to make reaading less of a chore. Using Dr. Daniel's method of
                    reading
                    may
                    seem daunting at first, but give it a try, it might surprise you. This method of reading uses active
                    recall
                    to practice pulling the information that you stored in your brain. More work upfront means less work
                    later
                    on when you're studying, because you have already practiced retrieving that information. Want to
                    find
                    out
                    more? Stop by and see us!</p>

                    be

                    <h3>Make Studying Fun!</h3>
                    <p>Studying by yourself can be boring and you can lose focus. Come into the TA room and study with
                        the TA's
                        and
                        other students! You can utalize the white board to write and draw out concepts and we do a lot
                        of hands
                        on
                        learning as well! Just wait until you get into the chapter about learning with classical and
                        operant
                        conditioning. Does the name pavlov ring any bells? </p>

                <h4>Testing Can Be Scary...</h4>
                <p>We get it, no one likes taking tests. However, we can show you a few tips and tricks to make it less
                    stressful. After you take your exam you can always come in to review it with one of the TA's. We can
                    help
                    you work through any of the problems you missed and make sure you get those concepts down. We can
                    also
                    check
                    to see if there are any patterns in your test-taking that we might be able to help you with.</p>
