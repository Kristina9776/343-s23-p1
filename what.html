            <h1>Reading techniques</h1>
            <p>Work with Dr. Daniel or the TA's to make reaading less of a chore. Using Dr. Daniel's method of reading
                may
                seem daunting at first, but give it a try, it might surprise you. This method of reading uses active
                recall
                to practice pulling the information that you stored in your brain. More work upfront means less work
                later
                on when you're studying, because you have already practiced retrieving that information. Want to find
                out
                more? Stop by and see us!</p>

            <h3>Make Studying Fun!</h3>
            <img src="images/shark.png" alt="Students using the white board" height="200">
            <p>Studying by yourself can be boring and you can lose focus. Come into the TA room and study with the TA's
                and
                other students! You can utalize the white board to write and draw out concepts and we do a lot of hands
                on
                learning as well! Just wait until you get into the chapter about learning with classical and operant
                conditioning. Does the name pavlov ring any bells? </p>
