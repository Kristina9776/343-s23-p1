                <h1>How to Master the Secret Art of Learning in Stealth</h1>
                <p>At first difficult, these techniques will become reflexive with practice and, like all ninja techniques, highly
                    efficient.</p>

                    <li>There is no psych Ninja
                        <p>Learning is ultimately a solitary journey.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Be Responsible.
                        <p>Each of us in in charge of our own learning. Teachers cannot learn for you.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Be Diligent.
                        <p>Learning is work: Do the work yourself or suffer the consequences. Hard work in training will make
                            studying easier when it counts.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Be Efficient.
                        <p>Well trained Ninjas do not think, they react. Although effortful at firts, practice, good techniques can
                            become second nature. Get good at it and it will seem like less work (tdlr, become efficient).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Know Yourself.
                        <p>While most things work for most people and some things don't work for anyone, not every weapon is useful
                            to every Ninja given their personal style and goals (immediate as well as long-term goals). The goal of
                            a Psych Ninji is to first know yourself and what works for you in given context.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Be Resourceful.
                        <p>Experiment with techniques to achieve perfection while committing 100% to none.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Be Flexible.
                        <p>Have many weapons and know how and when to use them: Not all techniques work with all material in all
                            contexts for all people. Be flexible, knowledgeable and resourceful.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Be Fluid.
                        <p>If what you are doing doesn't work do something else.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Be Forgiving.
                        <p>If a technigue does not work, learn from it and move on. Do not dwell on mistakes, learn from them.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Be Quiet.
                        <p>A Ninja is effective through action. Let your results speak for you, not your intentions, hopes, or
                            desires. Overconfidence, optimism and pessimism are all projectionsâ€¦they are not reality until the
                            battle has been fought. At the point the results are obvious.
